Android Google Maps visualization of world refugee flows

This Android app presents data obtained from the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) about the refugee flows worldwide in a way that would add some perspective for this sometimes emotive global and political issue.

It allows you to search for particular countries and displays where the refugees have come from.

It thus shows a comparison in terms of how many refugees are received by countries in relation to each other as well as compared to the total refugee number worldwide.
